#Sorting Visualizer Project
### Introduction:
The Sorting Visualizer project is an interactive web application designed to visually demonstrate various sorting algorithms in action. It provides users with a dynamic and engaging platform to explore different sorting techniques, compare their performance, and gain insights into their functionality and efficiency.# Sorting-Visualizer
The Sorting Visualizer project is an interactive web application designed to visually demonstrate various sorting algorithms in action. By animating the sorting process step by step, users can gain a deeper understanding of how different algorithms work and compare their performance in real-time.
### Algorithm Implementation
In here we can demonstrate the working functionality about different algorithm like Bubble Sort, merge sort , quick sort , selection sort,  insertion sort implementation.
### Visual Effect
in this project we can visualize that how a algorithm realy work and what is there process for sorting.

### Key Features:
1. **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic visualization of sorting algorithms to observe how elements are rearranged during the sorting process.
2. **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Supports various sorting techniques such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
3. **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to customize array size.
4. **Real-time Performance Metrics**: Displays performance metrics like comparisons.
5. **Educational Resource**: Serves as an educational tool for learning about sorting algorithms and their implementation through hands-on experimentation.
6. **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface with interactive controls for seamless navigation and interaction.

### Technologies Used:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
- Deployment: github for hosting the web application and making it accessible online

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the application using html web browser.
4. Open the application in your web browser and explore different sorting algorithms.

### Project Goals:
- To provide an interactive platform for learning and understanding sorting algorithms.
- To enable users to explore and compare various sorting techniques in real-time.
- To engage users through interactive visualization and customizable parameters, fostering a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms.
